# ABOUT
				
 Welcome to MyLab!
Thanks for choosing us and we recommend you read this few introduction of our project. We are sure you will find all what you need for your laboratory.

What is MyLab?
MyLab is an API designed to be used in a laboratory as a helpful tool for your workaday.
It consists on a platform with multiple sections where you can follow a protocol, or the stock that you have remaining as well as contact with your team using the chat or setting meetings in the calendar.
For this purpose, you need to be registered as a user in order to get access to the API, as this API is specially designed for people that work in a lab and, as you know, it cannot be public information.

# HOW IT WORKS?

MyLab consists in differents sections which are going to be described below.

-EXPERIMENTS: On this section you can select the protocol that you need to use in your study. You can select the required quantity of it and select also 
the user who perform this experiment, as we will save you experiment in a database (everyone has their own way to work!).
    Moreover, you will have as an output the desired protocol, with all the steps to follow and the desired quantities of each reactive. Then,
you can choose if you want to just see the protocol on the screen, or if you want to download it into a pdf file. An important thing is that you need to fill
all the form in order to get access to the protocol description, other wise you will recive a warning. In addition, if there are not enough quantity of 
reactives to perform the protocol, the APP will give you a special warning with this information.
