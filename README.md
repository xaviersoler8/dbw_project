# ABOUT
				
 Welcome to MyLab!
Thanks for choosing us and we recommend you read this few introduction of our project. We are sure you will find all what you need for your laboratory.

What is MyLab?
MyLab is an API designed to be used in a laboratory as a helpful tool for your workaday.
It consists on a platform with multiple sections where you can follow a protocol, or the stock that you have remaining as well as contact with your team using the chat or setting meetings in the calendar.
For this purpose, you need to be registered as a user in order to get access to the API, as this API is specially designed for people that work in a lab and, as you know, it cannot be public information.
