# ABOUT
				
 Welcome to MyLab!
Thanks for choosing us and we recommend you read this few introduction of our project. We are sure you will find all what you need for your laboratory.

What is MyLab?
MyLab is an API designed to be used in a laboratory as a helpful tool for your workaday.
It consists on a platform with multiple sections where you can follow a protocol, or the stock that you have remaining as well as contact with your team using the chat or setting meetings in the calendar.
For this purpose, you need to be registered as a user in order to get access to the API, as this API is specially designed for people that work in a lab and, as you know, it cannot be public information.

# HOW IT WORKS?

MyLab consists in differents sections which are going to be described below.

-EXPERIMENTS: On this section you can select the protocol that you need to use in your study. You can select the required quantity of it and select also 
the user who perform this experiment, as we will save you experiment in a database (everyone has their own way to work!).
    Moreover, you will have as an output the desired protocol, with all the steps to follow and the desired quantities of each reactive. Then,
you can choose if you want to just see the protocol on the screen, or if you want to download it into a pdf file. An important thing is that you need to fill
all the form in order to get access to the protocol description, other wise you will recive a warning. In addition, if there are not enough quantity of 
reactives to perform the protocol, the APP will give you a special warning with this information.

-STOCK: Here you can find as a list all the materials that you have in your laboratory with the remaining quantities. For each one, there is also a warning
icon that tells you if you need to buy more reactives soon! In this section, all the experiments that you previously submitted to the experiments section will automatically subtract the amount of each reactive used. This way, you can keep track of all lab materials.

-CALENDAR: In this section you can first visualize a calendar in order to organize your work. You can add a new event, edit an event or delete it! You can also choose the option to see the whole month, only one week or a specific day. Then, you can see what appointments are set with all the information required. 
You can also see al the event assigned in a table below, ordered by date. This can be useful in order to set all the lab meetings, presentations, deadlines, and even the tasks if you want!

-CHAT: This section allows you to be connected to your team and functions as a current chat. All messages will be saved, and it is designed to talk about the things related on the lab work, so you will be 24/7 informed on everything that is going on in the lab.
    
-PROFILE: This section allows you to log out. See you soon!
